This GLPI plugin aims to simplify the ticket escalation process in GLPI.  
It also adds a graphical history for assigned groups.  

A new dashboard on the user's home page is added, as well as a new criteria in ticket's search engine.   
Also, there's also a clone ticket feature, accessible through an icon on the ticket form.
